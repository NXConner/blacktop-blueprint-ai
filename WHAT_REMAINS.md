### Remediation Performed (this session)
- Standardized environment access with `src/lib/env.ts` and replaced client-side `process.env` with `getEnv(...)` in:
  - `src/services/hvac/hvac-management-service.ts`
  - `src/services/logistics/supply-chain-service.ts`
  - `src/services/veteran-services/veteran-certification.ts`
  - `src/integrations/gsa-auctions/gsa-auction-client.ts`
  - `src/components/atlas-hub/TerrainMapper.tsx`
  - `src/components/pavement-scan/PavementScanInterface.tsx`
  - `src/integrations/quickbooks/quickbooks-client.ts`
- ESLint cleanup:
  - Tuned `eslint.config.js` to align with project conventions and removed noisy rules
  - Removed unused `eslint-disable` directives in Supabase client and Tailwind config
  - Achieved zero linter errors and warnings
- Verified typecheck/build via `vite build --mode development` (green)

### Environment Configuration Notes
- Provide these at runtime/build as needed:
  - `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY`, `VITE_ROUTING_API_KEY`, `VITE_EIA_API_KEY`, `VITE_GSA_API_KEY`, `VITE_SAM_GOV_API_KEY`, `VITE_POINT_CLOUD_API_KEY`, `VITE_AI_ANALYSIS_API_KEY`
  - QuickBooks (server-side contexts): `QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID`, `QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT`, `QUICKBOOKS_REDIRECT_URI`
- Supabase: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### AI integration additions
- Integrated a Hugging Face client (`src/integrations/huggingface/hf-client.ts`) with token from `VITE_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` or `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`.
- Added an optional image segmentation demo on `UnifiedMap` to process uploaded images and receive a mask; next step is to convert mask to vector polygons and snap them to parcel edges.
- Recommendation: move token into env and never hard-code; add rate limiting and retries for inference calls.
